          gamer should have the opportunity to get a winner winner chicken
          dinner without being carried by the rest of the team. With your
          donation, you help us help a filthy casual noob become an overnight
          TTV, e-sports professional, 2000 IQ, mega poggies, 9000 K/D, Faze
          worthy, Chad.

          Not too long ago, the gaming community has forever complained about
          their trash team mates in games like Rainbow 6 seige, Call of Duty,
          CS:GO, and many others. We found that these complaints are a result of
          noobs like the one pictured here:
        </p>
        <p>
          These poor noobs need help and guidance in order to become the gamers
          that they dream to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          At MCF, we take random plebs from all kinds of games and put them
          through rigorous training that teaches them to play better and more
          confidently. We do all of this at no charge to the gamer, because most
          of these gamers couldn't really afford to take the course. We work
          hand-in-hand with gamers from the very beginning and monitor their
          progress. As our subjects continue, we make sure to continually
          increase the difficulty of training. This way, the gamers will be
          prepared to take on other Chads in the gaming world and win.
